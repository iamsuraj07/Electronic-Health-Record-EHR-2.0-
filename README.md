üìã Electronic Health Record (EHR) on Aptos Blockchain
Welcome to the EHR on Aptos project, a decentralized, secure, and transparent solution for managing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using Aptos Blockchain and Move Language. This project aims to revolutionize how patient data is stored, accessed, and shared across healthcare ecosystems.

üöÄ Project Overview
The EHR on Aptos is a Web3-based platform that enables the secure storage, management, and sharing of electronic health records. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures data integrity, patient privacy, and decentralized access control, providing a trustworthy solution for modern healthcare providers.

üåê Key Features
Decentralized Health Records: Store patient data securely on the blockchain, eliminating risks of data tampering.

Secure Access Control: Role-based permissions for healthcare providers (read-only, read-write).

Real-Time Data Access: Instant access to patient records across different healthcare settings.

Data Privacy & Compliance: Built with encryption and compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA.

Interoperability: Easily integrates with other health information systems using blockchain standards.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture
Blockchain Platform: Aptos Blockchain

Smart Contract Language: Move

Data Structure: Patient records, medical history, allergies, medications, immunizations

Security: Role-based access, data encryption, and secure key management

üì¶ Modules & Smart Contracts
1Ô∏è‚É£ Patient Management
Create Patient Record: Store demographics, medical history, allergies, and more.

Update Medical History: Add new health records dynamically.

Manage Immunizations & Medications: Track vaccination history and prescriptions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Healthcare Provider Management
Provider Authentication: Register healthcare professionals with unique IDs.

Access Control: Grant specific permissions for viewing or updating records.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Data Handling
Role-Based Permissions: Define access levels (read-only, read-write).

Data Encryption: Secure sensitive patient data through cryptographic mechanisms.

üìÑ Sample Move Code Overview
move

module 0x1::ehr {
    struct Patient has copy, drop, store {

        move_to(account, patient);
    }

    public fun add_medical_history(
        account: &signer,
        patient_id: vector<u8>,
        record: vector<u8>
    ) {
        let patient = borrow_global_mut<Patient>(account);
        vector::push_back(&mut patient.medical_history, record);
    }

            name: vector::empty(),
            license_number: vector::empty(),
            access_level,
        };
